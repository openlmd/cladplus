# CladPlus

Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) is a complex process, which is governed by a large
number of parameters. Among these parameters, powder flow rate, laser power,
and travel speed are typically used to control the process properties, such as
melt pool geometry, temperature, etc. Heat input control in LMD is realized by
adjusting laser power using an infrared image sensing camera as feedback. The
controller helps to overcome the effects of thermal variations and reduces
cladding geometric variations.
